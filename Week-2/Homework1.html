    <center>Not to be cliche, but this summer was by far the best yet. I had the opportunity to live<br /> in New York City through out the summer, and <b>love life</b>! 
    <p>
        My summer started by getting an apartment with 2 of my best friends from school about<br /> 10 blocks from campus. This is the view from our rooftop! Can we say <b>amazing</b>!<br />
        <br />

        Throughout the summer, I worked as an Account Executive Intern for a beauty and<br /> fashion PR agency. This led me to meeting my current boyfriend, who I spent<br /> travelling this summer with as well. We went to:
        <ul>
            <li>The Hamptons</li>
            <li>Boston</li>
            <li>Cape Cod</li>
            <li>Provincetown</li>
            <li>Nantucket</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        In addition to all these amazing things, I went back home to New Orleans for Father's<br /> Day and it was so nice to see all of my family and catch up with<br /> everyone! Here is a picture of me and some of my cousins!

        My family and I also spent a week in San Antonio, TX. A friend of ours was getting<br /> married there, and can we just say <i>sweaty much</i>? I have literally never been<br /> that hot at a wedding... But we made the most of it! 
    </p>
        While in San Antonio, we:
        <ul>
            <li>went shopping</li>
            <li>river tubing</li>
            <li>zip lining through the hills</li>
            <li>and sweat a lot...(it was 100+ degrees everyday)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        This is my mom and sister from when we were zip lining. How cute are they?<br />
        <br />

        Here is a link to a small video I made from our zip lining trip!<br />

        As the summer has come to an end, and school resumes, I am very excited for this year<br /> to come because I finally get to start my two minors, Creative<br /> Technology and Mathematics. I can't wait to see what opportunities arrise this year<br /> in the work place.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Here's to a wonderful year!
