        My name is Gavin Laiche and I am in my second year<br /> at FIT. I am from New Orleans, LA and was<br /> born and raised there. The South is definitely a<br /> whole different ball park than New York City, but<br /> I think I am adjusting very well! One of<br /> the things about the things I miss most about home<br /> is the food. The food in New York City<br /> truly does not compare to the food in New Orleans.<br /> I originally was planning to go to architecture<br /> school, but changed my mind and wanted to do fashion at <br />the last minute. So, I applied to FIT on a whim and got <br />accepted with early admittance! I chose the business side <br />of the fashion industry to focus on, but I also wanted<br /> to incorporate my artistic side as well. That is when I discovered the <br />Creative Technology Minor and knew it would be a perfect fit.<br /> While as FIT, I have accomplished many feats,<br /> with one being a captain of the dance company<br /> at school. Here is a quick clip of some of my <br />own choreography from our last show! And<br /> that is all about me!
