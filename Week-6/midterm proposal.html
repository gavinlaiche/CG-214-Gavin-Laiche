        For my midterm project, I want to base it on my home<br />town of New Orleans, LA, and focus specifically<br />on the creole cuisine. The food back home is one of the<br />major things that I miss about it. Not being able to<br />eat my Grammie&#146;s red beans and rice every<br />Monday is absolutely killing me.</center>

        In terms of the platform for the midterm, I think I<br />will attempt to successfully create a hypertext art piece.<br />From the examples I reviewed through Github, they<br />seem more fun to create than just a standard blog! I am<br />going to pray I don&#146;t do it wrong!
