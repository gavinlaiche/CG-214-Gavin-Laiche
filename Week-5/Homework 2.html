        This course is introducing me to web page coding for the first time. Honestly, it looks like <br /> <b>hieroglyphics</b> or something. I have always been interested in graphic design and <br /> expressing my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/oqtyw5kinxz452j/AADVPNp9LPrOr6mmCTBtQg4Ja?dl=0" target="_blank"><i>creative side</i></a>, so hopefully this course will set the ground work. I have <br /> done some graphic work in branding and logo design. Here are 2 recent branding <br /> projects I have worked on.<br /><br />

        I will be in everyone's dust by next week because this stuff is so confusing but hey at <br /> least I can say I tried. Everyone else in class is gonna be like:<br />

        <br />
        But it's aight because I know Shaun has my back and will drag me through these tough <br /> times (insert heart bc I wasn't sure how to do that)
        <br />
        <br />
        Don't even get me started on github... What the hell is a README.MD?? Like does it <br /> want to be read?<br />

        <br />
        And can we just <b>PRAISE</b> the Lawd for that spell check extension? <br />That just saved my life so now I will be spelling for the GAWDS.
        <br />
        Until next time ladies!<br />
