           A thick, robust roux-based soup sometimes thickened with okra or file'. There are thousands of variations, such as shrimp or seafood gumbo, chicken or duck gumbo, okra and file' gumbo. It may look unappetizing, but I can solemnly swear that you will fall in love at the first bite. The filé powder is like no other spice you have ever tasted.
