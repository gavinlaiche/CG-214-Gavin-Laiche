           The traditional Monday meal in New Orleans, red beans are cooked with ham or sausage and seasonings, and served over rice. One of my fondest memories of home is getting off the school bus and going straight to Grammie's house on Monday's for dinner. I would eat 2, 3, or hell, sometimes even 4 bowls of her red beans... Addictive to say the least.
