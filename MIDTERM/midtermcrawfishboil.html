           Crawfish, sometimes spelled "crayfish," resemble lobsters, but are much smaller. They can be served many ways: in etouffees, jambalaya, gumbos or, simply boiled. Crawfish have a soft spot in my heart not only because of their incredible flavors, but because it means getting the family together for a good time. Everyone you love dearly is huddled around a table, busting open crawfish tails with their bare hands, eating like mongrols. It's a lovely sight to see.
